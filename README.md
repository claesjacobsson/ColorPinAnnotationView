ColorPinAnnotationView is an iOS Swift class that can use
any custom color, instead of the three colors that can be
used when using the standard MKPinAnnotationView class.

ColorPinAnnotationView has a pinColor property as well as
an animatesDrop property, which is enabled by default. It
looks a little bit different from the default pin, so you
should use it for every pin in your app, if you decide to
use it in your project.


Demo
----

The demo project in this repository shows you how you can
use ColorPinAnnotationView to add pins with random colors
to the map. 


CocoaPod
--------

You can easily add this library to your own project using
CocoaPods (check out https://cocoapods.org). Just add the
following to your pod file:

    pod 'ColorPinAnnotationView', '<version>'
